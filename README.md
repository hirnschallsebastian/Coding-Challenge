# Coding-Challenge
Weekly coding challenges!         

#### Concept:
Every week I pick a new interesting topic and try to code a useful example as fast as possible!

#### Languages:
I tend to use JavaScript with the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library for visualization purposes and C/C++ if speed is a concern! 

#### More information:
You can find a full list of all challenges and a detaild explanation on my [Blog  at blog.hirnschall.net](https://blog.hirnschall.net)
